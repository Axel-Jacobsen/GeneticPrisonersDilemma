## Why?

Listening to [Dr. Robert Sapolsky's lecture on Human Behavioral Biology,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA) he discussed game theory and how certain game theory strategies were found in nature. 
I believe that it would be interesting to see if these strategies (e.g. [Tit-for-Tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat)) could be developed by a genetic algorithm.
